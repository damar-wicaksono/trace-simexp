``trace-simexp`` Package
========================

Welcome to the ``trace_simexp`` package documentation, a python3 package to 
conduct a computer experiment for thermal-hydraulics system code TRACE!

If you're just getting started with ``trace-simexp``, please start with 
:ref:`trace_simexp_introduction`. 
If you already familiar with it, the :ref:`trace_simexp_user_guide` part of the
documentation provides more detailed reference to the internals of the package.
Finally, if you are thinking to make modification or extend the capability of 
the package perhaps it is a good idea to check some 
:ref:`trace_simexp_implementation` of the current version so you can understand
better its design philosophy as well as current (and *inherent*) limitations.
